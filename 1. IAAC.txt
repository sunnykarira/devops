Four Approaches to Manage Infrastructure

application , environment, hardware etc. etc.

How to manage in most effective way

LIFECYCLE EVENTS (Phases of the infrastructure)


We have some servers.
we install OS on the servers.
We configure the environment.
Deploy the application.
Integrate the applications (talk with databases).
Update patch
Tear down the infra.


APPROACHES

Manual
Scripts
Golden Images (Templates)
Iaac


Scripts VS Iaac (procedural vs declerative)

Scripts => Automate repetable tasks , procedural program, focus on how. (construction worker)

IAAC => We write DSL (domain specific language, abstracted language) and then the providers take care of it ,focuses on what. (Architect)
declerative approach, revision control, code review, automation etc.
Recreate the infra on other server.
Migration and Disaster Recovery is good.
Absolute Consistency.



WHAT IS IAAC?

Ability to describe the state of the infra.
Consistent provisioning and config of env.
repetable, Flexible and automable
Treat it similar to application code
